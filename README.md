- We will do first pull request together so let me know when you've completed your first ticket

## Troubleshooting

- If the app is throwing many errors during NPM install, please ensure that you are using NVM to version control the Node and NPM for the project.
  - Node.JS = 21.6.0
  - npm = 9.6.7
- If you are having issues with npm dependencies, try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- If port 5000 is being blocked despite restart and you are using mac, it could be your AIRPLAY RECEIVER. Apple has decided to use Node's most common port for it.
- Reach out to Olivia on slack if none of the above work
